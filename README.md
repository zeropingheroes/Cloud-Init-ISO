Cloud Init ISO
==============

Many premade cloud images (e.g. Fedora Cloud, Ubuntu Cloud) use some form of 
cloud-init to set instance/user metadata, such as hostnames and SSH keys. This 
works well when used in a cloud infrastructure such as EC2 or OpenStack that can 
seed this data, but not so well when used for local VMs, or an out-of-the-box 
XenServer installation.

However, [cloud-init supports an CD/ISO datasource][1], which can be loaded 
whether running the machine locally in KVM, VirtualBox, or on a XenServer host. 

This repository and guide aims to make this task a lot easier by pre-seeding a 
template and script. It draws heavily on existing resources ([2][2], [3][3]).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository. (optional: maybe create and checkout your own branch?)
2. Modify the `meta-data` YAML file to specify your `instance-id` and `local-hostname`.
3. Modify the `cloud-config` YAML file to specify a password and/or SSH keys; 
   the cloud image determines the default user's login name 
   (e.g. `fedora` in Fedora Cloud).
4. (optional) Commit your changes in git. This helps the build script name your ISO.
5. Verify that you have the dependency `genisoimage`. In RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, 
   `sudo yum install genisoimage`; in Ubuntu/Debian, `sudo apt-get install genisoimage`.
6. Build the ISO using `./build.sh`. You can either specify an output filename as the 
   first parameter (e.g. `./build.sh output-file.iso`), or you can let the script decide 
   on the filename. If you are working inside a git repository, the build script should 
   name your file after the branch and commit hash, such as 
   `frost-init-20141228.4d48bab28b6d8f9c43f7b6e36238ef6863b41e90.iso`.
7. If everything went well, attach the ISO file to your VM by methods 
   conventional to your virtualization hypervisor.
8. Boot the VM!
